<!-- HEADER 1-5: Plug-Ins -->

Electric plug-ins are additional JAR files that can be downloaded separately
to enhance the system's functionality.
If you are building from the savannah.gnu.org repository,
then all of these files are already available.
If, however, you are running from the GNU download,
then these files must be downloaded separately.
<P>
Currently, these plug-ins are available:

<LI><B>Static Free Software extras (IRSIM, Animation)</B>
This plugin contains all of the pieces of Electric, written by Static Free Software, that are unable to be packaged
with the GNU download (for licensing reasons).
It includes the IRSIM simulator and interfaces to the 3D Animation options.
The IRSIM simulator is a gate-level simulator from Stanford University.
Although originally written in C, it was translated to Java so that it could plug into Electric.
The Static Free Software extras are available from <A HREF="https://www.staticfreesoft.com">Static Free Software</A> at
<A HREF="https://www.staticfreesoft.com/electricSFS-9.08.jar">www.staticfreesoft.com/electricSFS-9.08.jar</A>.
</LI>

<LI><B>Bean Shell</B>
The Bean Shell can be added to Electric to enable Java scripting and parameter evaluation.
Advanced operations that make use of cell parameters will need this plug-in.
The Bean Shell is available from <A HREF="https://www.beanshell.org">www.beanshell.org</A>.
</LI>

<LI><B>Jython</B>
Jython can be added to Electric to enable Python scripting.
Jython is available from <A HREF="https://www.jython.org">www.jython.org</A>.
Build a "standalone" installation to create a JAR file that can be used with Electric.
</LI>

<LI><B>3D</B>
The 3D facility lets you view an integrated circuit in three-dimensions.
It requires the Java3D package, which
is available from the Java Community Site, <A HREF="https://jogamp.org">jogamp.org</A>.
You will need four JAR files to add to Electric: j3dcore.jar, j3dutils.jar, vecmath.jar, and jogamp-fat.jar.
If 3D views cause Electric to crash, try adding this to the VM arguments:
<b>--add-opens=java.desktop/sun.awt=ALL-UNNAMED</b>
</LI>

<LI><B>Animation</B>
Another extra that can be added to the 3D facility is 3D animation.
This requires the Java Media Framework (JMF).
The Java Media Framework is available from <a href="https://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> at
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/java-media-framework.html">www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/java-media-framework.html</a>.

<P>
To attach a plugin, the JAR files must be in the CLASSPATH.
The simplest way to do that is to invoke Electric from the command line, and specify the classpath.
For example, to add the beanshell (a file named "bsh-2.0b1.jar"), type:
<BR><CODE><FONT SIZE="-1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java -classpath electric.jar:bsh-2.0b1.jar com.sun.electric.Electric</CODE></FONT>
<BR>
Note that you must explicitly mention the main Electric class (com.sun.electric.Electric)
when using plug-ins since all of the jar files are grouped together as the "classpath".
<P>
<!-- NEED 3in -->
On Windows, you must use the ";" to separate jar files,
and you might also have to quote the collection since ";" separates commands:
<BR><CODE><FONT SIZE="-1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java -classpath "electric.jar;bsh-2.0b1.jar" com.sun.electric.Electric</CODE></FONT>
<BR>
The above text can be placed into a ".bat" file to make a double-clickable Electric launch.
You can also add Java switches and special Electric controls mentioned in <A HREF="chap01-03.html#chap01-03">Section 1-3</A>.
For example, to add in the SFS extension and extend the memory to 1GB, you can put this line in the ".bat" file:
<BR><CODE><FONT SIZE="-1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java -classpath "electric.jar;electricSFS.jar" -mx1000m<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.sun.electric.Electric</CODE></FONT>
<P>

(in menu <b>Help</b>).
