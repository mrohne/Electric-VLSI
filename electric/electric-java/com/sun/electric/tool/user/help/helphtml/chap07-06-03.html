<!-- HEADER 7-6-3: The Photonics Technology -->

The Photonics technology demonstrates Electric's capability to design light-wave
paths on a chip.
These can be arbitrarily curved and can interact with electronics.
Like all circuits in Electric, photonics light guides have topology that lets light paths be matched easily to schematics.
<p>
The current Photonics technology is not complete, nor does it align with any real Photonics fabrication.
Instead, it exists as a starting point for any real photonics work and demonstrates the power of Electric to handle
unusual circuitry.
